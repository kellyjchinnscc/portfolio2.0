      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p>This was a personal project, done over the Summer of 2020. I was the sole developer on this project and created this application to teach myself React, which seems to be one of the most in-demand frameworks in Halifax.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
      <li>React JS - A Framework which focuses on compartmentalization of a website to promote maintainability.</li>
      <li>Fetch API - A Javascript set of functions which allow web developers to grab data from a remote source.</li>
      <li>Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS to develop the "skeleton" of the website.</li>
      <li>Bootstrap - A CSS Framework to help with styling of the website.</li>
      <br>
      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>Compared to projects I've completed in my first year, this project was a step-up in complexity! It required the compartmentalization of code with React and emphasized why it's so important. This project was the "coming together" of all of my first year skills combined with a brand new technology that I was new to - React. This is very important, because Javascript is the language of alot of modern websites. Completion of this project is proof that I possessed a basic understanding of the language, plus a little extra!</p>
