    <h1>Major Web Developer Skill Demonstrated: Testing and Debugging / Electron</h1>

    <!-- <h1>It's a Desktop App!</h1> -->
    <br><br>
    <h2>Role</h2>
    <p>Seeing as this was a school project, I was the sole developer. With Electron being a rather unfamiliar technology, I had to do alot of self-learning in order to complete this   project. Some of the resources that I used included the Electron Documentation Page, Youtube videos and my instructor.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <li>Electron JS - A Framework which allows Web Developers to create Desktop Apps without having to learn an entire new language.</li>
    <li>Knex - A Javascript Library which allows web developers to connect and perform CRUD Operations on Relational Databases.</li>
    <li>SQLite - A lightweight, resource-sparing Relational Database Platform.</li>
    <br>
    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest coding lessons that I learned doing this project is the importance of debugging. By its nature, Electron requires developers to pass data between modules. Debugging lets the developer know where the data is in the data passing cycle and where it may be coming from. Some of the techniques, technologies and tools that were used in this project to help with debugging include the console.log() function and the Electron Web Dev Tools which allow us to inspect and debug the desktop app like it were in the browser!</p>
