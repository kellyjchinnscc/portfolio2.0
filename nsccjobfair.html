      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p>In this project, I was on a team of 3 developers. My biggest contribution to the project was the dynamic display of the registration forms. Originally, the form in the wireframe/storyboard 
        was exceptionally long and would've likely negatively affected User Experience. With some DOM traversal and vanilla Javascript, I was able to only display certain parts of the form when needed.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
      <li>Laravel - An MVC Framework written in PHP. This was used to communicate with the database, configure web routes and authentication.</li>
      <li>Javascript - The programming language of browsers to make websites and pages more interactive.</li>
      <li>Bootstrap - A CSS Framework to help with styling the website.</li>
      <br>
      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>This was the first time I had worked with a team of developers. As such, it was the first time I was exposed to using Git in a team environment.
        This was also the first time I worked on a project where there was an existing codebase where I had to learn and develop from. Up until this project, I was writing code from scratch. </p>
