    <h1>Major Web Developer Skill Demonstrated: Client Service</h1>

    <div>
      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p>For this particular role, I was a part of a team at a Staffing company called Carecor Health Services. I was part of a team of 7 staffing professionals who had to be in constant contact with clients on a daily basis to assess their staffing needs and our ability to fill those needs.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Skills Gained and Used:</h2>
      <li>Maintaining client contact with honesty to build and solidify relationships.</li>
      <li>Working with team members to increase shift fill rates by 5% over 3 months, increasing revenues as a result.</li>
      <li>Communication etiquette over phone and email.</li>
      <br>
      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>This role helped to develop my non-technical skills which seem to be under-valued somewhat in the tech industry by most soon-to-be grads. Having this experience is a blessing, especially when combined with my now-developing tech skills, so that I can bridge the gap in communication between clients and tech teams that I may end up working with.</p>
